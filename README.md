<h1 align="center">Hi!ðŸ‘‹I am Zen!</h1>
<p>I am a fresher developer who is active seeking for opportunities to improve my skills in creating responsive and user-friendly websites. </p>
<p>I started my journey on programming when I rely on Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) heavily to automated my daily task as a MDM Analyst to process data. And now I decided to explore more on web developing, fulfilling my interest and at the same time create more oppotunities for my career advancement!</p>

<p>I am currently focusing on learning HTML, CSS and Javascript:</p>
