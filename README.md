<h1 align="center">Hi!ðŸ‘‹I am Zen!</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m a self-taught software developer with experience in software integration, front-end design, and database development. I currently work on developing data-driven dashboard applications, integrating multiple systems and data sources into interactive, real-time visualization platforms.</p>

<p>My focus is on building responsive interfaces, connecting APIs, and designing structured databases that support performance and scalability. I prioritize clean, maintainable code and practical engineering solutions that improve usability and reliability.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m open to new opportunities where I can apply my full-stack and integration skills to build efficient, user-focused applications.</p>
